`GestureSign.Common` is the shared application and runtime library used across GestureSign. It defines application/action models, gesture managers, configuration and JSON persistence, localization, per-user named-pipe IPC, and the plugin contracts and manager. The daemon and control panel work against these shared models rather than maintaining separate representations of profiles, gestures, or plugin commands.

| `GestureSign.Common/Plugins/IPlugin.cs`, `GestureSign.Common/Plugins/PluginManager.cs` | Define the plugin lifecycle and discover, initialize, resolve, and execute plugin implementations |
| `GestureSign.Common/Localization/LocalizationProvider.cs` | Load localized text from registered assemblies or language files, using the configured/current UI culture and English fallback |

## Runtime flow

The capture implementation supplies point events to the shared managers. The application manager identifies the target window and matching profile context; the gesture manager matches captured point paths against saved samples. On recognition, the plugin manager obtains configured actions, checks their conditions and device/mode restrictions, resolves enabled commands, then invokes the corresponding plugin.

`GestureManager` is for drawn point-pattern gestures. Continuous motions use a separate catalog: an action stores a `ContinuousGestureName` reference, while `ContinuousGestureManager` owns the named motion definitions. The daemon and control panel load their own catalog instances from persisted data; process coordination uses the IPC layer.

## Persistence and compatibility

`AppConfig` selects application-data and configuration paths. Standard builds use the user's roaming and local application-data folders; portable builds use an `AppData` directory beside the application. `FileManager` reads and writes JSON, optionally including type names for polymorphic application/action data, and coordinates reads/writes with backup paths. The application and gesture managers try their persisted data and backup locations before their respective legacy/default fallbacks.

The current application loader also migrates legacy action-embedded continuous gestures. Old action JSON can deserialize its `ContinuousGesture` property into the compatibility shape in `GestureSign.Common/Applications/Action.cs`; `GestureSign.Common/Applications/ApplicationManager.cs` waits for the catalog's initial load and calls `ContinuousGestureManager.AdoptLegacy`. `GestureSign.Common/Gestures/ContinuousGestureManager.cs` delegates to `ContinuousGestureCatalog.MigrateLegacy`: for valid motions (2–10 contacts and a defined direction), it reuses a catalog entry with the same motion or creates one, then replaces the embedded value with the action's `ContinuousGestureName`. Invalid legacy values are discarded, and an action that already has a catalog reference keeps it. If the catalog grows it is saved; if any embedded value was removed, the application data is saved as well.

## Integration points

- `GestureSign.Daemon` supplies the live capture events and uses the shared application, gesture, and plugin managers to select and execute configured behavior.
- `GestureSign.ControlPanel` edits the shared application, action, gesture, and continuous-gesture models and persists changes through the shared configuration layer.
- `GestureSign.CorePlugins` and optional plugin assemblies implement `IPlugin`; `PluginManager` discovers the core assembly and DLLs in the runtime `Plugins` directory.
- `GestureSign.PointPatterns` provides point-pattern comparison used by `GestureManager`.
- `NamedPipe.GetUserPipeName` appends the current Windows user's SID to the pipe name. `IpcCommands` provides the command identifiers (including configuration, application, gesture, and continuous-gesture reload operations); update sender and receiver behavior together when changing this protocol.
